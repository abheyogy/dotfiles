My dotools
----------

Most people call them dotfiles, I call them dotools.

Philosophy (Two Cents)
----------------------

Everybody loves beauty, everything tries to achieve beauty through symmetry. To create beautiful software, a hacker
writes inspirational poems in any given language and has a set of beautiful tools.

A skilled craftsman will spend 60-70% of his times building and maintaining his tools while spending only 30-40% on
the real work. If there is no personal care given to ones tools, one is simply a mindless worker a.k.a. coder.

History
-------

These dotfiles have been created, updated and maintained from my last 5 years of experience. This has been inspired by
various hackers around the world, as my travels have given me ample opportunity to meet various people from various
backgrounds, I find myself left with an awesome repository of various tools in various languages doing various
different things.

Vision
------

To have a one click setup for all of my tools related to my hacker ego; These tools should setup a ubiquitous environment
on all major Linux/Mac/Windows platforms and provide me with more time to chill, relax, spend time with my friends & play
music.
